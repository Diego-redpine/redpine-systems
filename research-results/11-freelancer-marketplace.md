## Competitor Analysis

### 1. Webflow Certified Partners

**How Matching Works:**
Webflow offers two discovery paths:
- **Get Matched**: Owners fill out a project brief (budget, services needed, timeline). Webflow reviews it and recommends Certified Partners based on criteria like availability, minimum project price, services offered, and specialization. ([Source](https://experts.webflow.com/))
- **Browse Directory**: Owners search the partner directory with filters for services, budget, location, and more. ([Source](https://webflow.com/certified-partners/browse))

**Freelancer Profiles:**
Each Certified Partner profile includes past work images, pricing details, bio, service types, and availability. Partners are categorized into four tiers: Certified Partner, Premium Partner, Certified Partner Enterprise, and Premium Partner Enterprise. ([Source](https://webflow.com/certified-partners/apply))

**Fee Structure:**
- **Template sales**: Creators earn 95% commission (Webflow keeps 5% for payment processing). This was updated in October 2025 from the previous 80% rate. ([Source](https://webflow.com/updates/template-creator-enhancements))
- **Client payments**: Partners set a "Desired Monthly Profit" on top of hosting costs. Webflow adds processing fees. Partners keep 100% of their profit margin. ([Source](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/35335039878035-Client-payments))
- **Enterprise referrals**: 10% commission on annual contract value for first 12 months. ([Source](https://webflow.com/certified-partners/apply))
- **No commission on service work itself**: Webflow does not take a cut of the project fees between client and partner.

**Handoff:**
Freelancers build in Webflow's designer tool, then hand off using Webflow Editor (a simplified editing mode clients can use without breaking layouts). Client billing can be transferred directly so clients pay Webflow for hosting. ([Source](https://webflow.com/blog/hand-off-a-website))

**Maintenance Retainers:**
Partners can set recurring "Monthly Profit" charges through client billing, effectively creating maintenance retainers. ([Source](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/35335039878035-Client-payments))

**Scale:**
Over 1,200 Certified Partners across four tiers, out of a community of 2+ million designers. ([Source](https://experts.webflow.com/))

**Template Earnings:**
Average template creators earn from a few hundred to over $30,000, depending on number of templates and sales volume. Typical template pricing: $49-$79. ([Source](https://www.nikolaibain.com/blog/how-much-can-you-make-from-webflow-templates))

---

### 2. Wix Marketplace

**How Vetting Works:**
Wix Marketplace Partners undergo an application process and regular performance evaluations. As of 2025, they must maintain active certification status and demonstrate expertise through the platform. Previously, designers needed at least 3 active Wix websites to qualify. ([Source](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-studio-applying-to-join-the-wix-marketplace))

**Pricing Transparency:**
Prices are NOT listed on the marketplace. The marketplace explicitly says: "Before you hire a Wix Professional, make sure to discuss and agree on the price and payment method that works for both of you." All pricing is negotiated directly between owner and freelancer. ([Source](https://www.wix.com/marketplace/how-it-works))

**Categories of Services:**
- Web Design (full site builds)
- Small Tasks (domain connection, email setup, app installs)
- Online Store creation
- Web Development (advanced functionality via Velo)
- Marketing & Promotion
([Source](https://www.wix.com/marketplace/hire))

**Fee Structure:**
- **No commission on service work**: Wix takes zero commission on marketplace transactions. Partners set their own prices and handle payments directly with clients.
- **No listing fees**: Free to join and list services.
- **Revenue share on client plans**: Partners earn 0.05% on client daily sales up to $2,000, and 0.10% on daily sales over $2,000 (processed through Wix Payments).
- **Template sales**: Partners keep 100% of template sale profits.
([Source](https://www.wix.com/marketplace/join), [Source](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-studio-receiving-revenue-share))

**Discovery:**
Two paths: (1) "Find me a professional" -- owners answer questions about needs and budget, Wix matches with partners who respond within 1 business day. (2) "Explore professionals" -- browse and filter by service, price, location, and language. ([Source](https://www.wix.com/marketplace/how-it-works))

**Important Note:** Wix explicitly states: "Wix doesn't get involved in disputes." Partners are independent third parties. ([Source](https://support.wix.com/en/article/disputes-with-a-wix-professional))

---

### 3. Shopify Experts / Partner Directory

**Major Change:** Shopify shut down the original Experts Marketplace in December 2023 (stopped accepting new jobs in October 2023). It was replaced with the Shopify Partner Directory. Shopify cited resource costs vs. revenue as the reason. ([Source](https://boldmatch.com/blog/the-shopify-experts-marketplace-became-shopifys-partner-directory/))

**Categories:**
Store Setup, Store Design, Custom Development, Marketing & Sales, Troubleshooting, and Expert Guidance (via the new Partner Directory). Over 550 professional partners listed. ([Source](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/partner-program/about))

**How Stores Find Experts:**
The Partner Directory includes search functionality, detailed partner profiles, tier badges indicating experience levels, and "Verified Skills" credentials. Merchants can filter by price range, service type, industry, location, and language. ([Source](https://boldmatch.com/blog/the-shopify-experts-marketplace-became-shopifys-partner-directory/))

**Pricing:**
Expert hourly rates range from $15-$200+. Project-based pricing ranges from $500 to $20,000+ depending on complexity.
- Beginner: ~$15/hr
- Intermediate: ~$33/hr
- Expert: Up to $95/hr
- Senior/Plus: $100-$200/hr
([Source](https://invedus.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-hire-a-shopify-expert-ultimate-guide/))

**Fee Structure:**
- **Referral commission**: Partners earn 20% recurring referral commission on Shopify subscriber fees for referred merchants (as of Jan 2025).
- **App store revenue share**: Shopify takes 20% of app sales.
- **Theme revenue share**: Developers earn 70-80% (Shopify takes 20-30%).
- **Bonus programs**: $500 per eligible merchant referral (up to 10), on top of the 20% recurring.
([Source](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/partner-program/how-to-earn))

### 4. Fiverr

**Website Design Gigs:**
Small business website design services on Fiverr typically range from $20-$70 for basic gigs, with an average cost of $45. More comprehensive projects run $500-$10,000. Freelancers commonly build on WordPress, Wix, Shopify, and Squarespace. ([Source](https://www.fiverr.com/resources/guides/graphic-design/website-design-costs))

**Fee Structure:**
- **Seller fee**: Flat 20% commission on all earnings (including tips). For orders over $500, the first $500 is at 20%, remaining portion at 5%.
- **Buyer fee**: 5.5% platform fee on every order (minimum $2 for orders under $50).
- Total platform take: ~25.5% on a typical transaction.
([Source](https://weareindy.com/fiverr-fee-calculator))

**Quality Problems (Verbatim Complaints):**
- "Not a service, not a product, and not even a draft. It was nothing more than a broken link and empty promises." -- [PissedConsumer](https://fiverr.pissedconsumer.com/review.html)
- A customer "hired someone to build a website... received a direct copy of another client's site." -- [JessCreatives](https://jesscreatives.com/blog/why-you-should-stop-using-fiverr/)
- "One of the most dishonest, unprofessional experiences." -- [BBB Complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/new-york/profile/job-listing-service/fiverr-inc-0121-146396/complaints)

**Fiverr's Stance:** Their terms state the platform "is not responsible for the content, quality, or level of service provided by sellers, even Pro Freelancers or Top Rated Sellers." ([Source](https://www.manypixels.co/blog/get-a-designer/fiverr-scams))

---

### 5. Upwork

**Fee Structure (Current as of May 2025):**
Upwork moved from a fixed 10% fee to a **variable fee system ranging from 0% to 15%** based on market dynamics. The fee is visible before submitting a proposal and won't change once a contract is active. Average effective fee: 12-13% for most freelancers. ([Source](https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211062538-Learn-about-the-Freelancer-Service-Fee))

Previous tiered structure (discontinued): 20% on first $500, 10% on $500-$10K, 5% above $10K per client.

**Freelancer Complaints (Verbatim):**
- "VERY frustrating" -- regarding fee changes from 10% to up to 15%. ([Source](https://freelancerfiles.com/blogs/news/increased-upwork-fees-15))
- "Upwork hasn't provided detailed transparency around how various factors are weighted in determining fees." ([Source](https://theonlineworker.com/upwork-fees-in-2025-unpacking-the-twist-from-0-to-15/))
- "For many freelancers, this can represent $5,000-$10,000 in annual fees." ([Source](https://freelancerfiles.com/blogs/news/increased-upwork-fees-15))
- "Increasing fees without a clear immediate benefit can make freelancers feel like expendable resources instead of valued partners." ([Source](https://freelancerfiles.com/blogs/news/increased-upwork-fees-15))

**Website Design Pricing:**
Freelance web designers on Upwork charge $50-$150/hr, with web design projects for small businesses typically ranging $2,000-$10,000. ([Source](https://www.upwork.com/hire/webflow-freelancers/cost/))

---

### 6. 99designs (by Vista)

**How It Works:**
Two models:
1. **Contest Model**: Client posts a design brief with a prize. Multiple designers compete by submitting designs. Client gives feedback through rounds, then picks a winner. Bronze ($599, ~30 designs), Silver ($899, ~60 designs), Gold ($1,599, top designers + account manager), Platinum ($2,499).
2. **Direct Hire (1-to-1 Projects)**: Browse designer portfolios, request quotes, hire directly.
([Source](https://99designs.com/how-it-works))

**Fee Structure:**
- **Contest model**: Platform takes 30-40% of the contest price. On a $799 Gold contest, designer payout is approximately $479-$559 (60-70%).
- **Direct hire**: Designers set their own rates; 99designs takes a smaller percentage.
- **All designers are vetted** through a quality screening process.
([Source](https://www.webbroi.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-99designs-contests))

**Design-to-Development Gap:**
99designs is design-only. They deliver design files (PSD, AI, etc.) but NOT functional code. The client still needs a developer to build the actual website. This is a significant gap. ([Source](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/99designs-experience/))

**Pricing for Web Design:**
- Bronze: $599
- Silver: $899
- Gold: $1,599
- Platinum: $2,499
([Source](https://skilllinkup.com/en/resources/99designs-pricing))

---

### 7. Dribbble Hiring

**How It Works:**
Three pricing tiers for employers:
1. **Hire a Freelancer (Free)**: Search designer profiles, send proposal requests. 2-5% platform fee scaled by project size. Payment held in escrow until project is final.
2. **Post a Job ($150/mo)**: Post job listings for full-time, part-time, or contract roles. No placement fees.
3. **Hiring Suite ($300/mo)**: Featured/pinned job posts and messages, ad-free browsing, VIP support.
([Source](https://dribbble.com/hiring))

**Designer Rates:**
- Digital Designer: ~$80/hr
- UI/UX Designer: ~$60/hr
- Lead Designer: ~$120/hr
- Product Designer: ~$135/hr
(Based on Dribbble marketplace listings)

**Key Feature:** Dribbble holds payment until project completion (escrow model), similar to what Red Pine should implement. ([Source](https://dribbble.com/hiring))

---

### 8. Squarespace Circle

**Not a marketplace** -- it's a partner/referral program.

**How It Works:**
Free to join. Three tiers based on activity points (client sites launched):
- **Silver (0-999 points)**: 10% discount on new annual subscriptions, 3-month free trials, priority support.
- **Gold (1,000+ points)**: 20% discount, 6-month free trials, in-person events, early feature access.
- **Platinum (5,000+ points)**: Highest discounts (up to 25%), dedicated support queue.
([Source](https://www.squarespace.com/circle))

**Referral Payments:**
Circle partners earn money for bringing clients to Squarespace. Silver partners receive $20 per Squarespace Payments referral. ([Source](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418794433421-Squarespace-Circle-referral-payments))

**Key Limitation:** Squarespace doesn't match clients with Circle members. There's no marketplace or directory for clients to find designers. The matching happens organically (freelancers market themselves externally, build on Squarespace). ([Source](https://www.squarespace.com/circle))

**Freelancer Criticism:**
New Silver members get worse benefits than before (3-month trial vs. old 6-month, 10% discount vs. old 20%). Smaller freelancers feel squeezed. ([Source](https://www.squareko.com/blog/squarespace-for-pros-the-complete-circle-day-2025-update-guide))

## User Complaints & Pain Points

### Business Owner Complaints About Hiring Freelancers

**Quality Issues:**
> "People complained about the inadequate proposals they got from freelancers on the platform and how many freelancers pretended to be experts but had little to no relevant experience."
-- [Freelancer.com Review, MarketerHire](https://marketerhire.com/blog/freelancer-review)

> "Chances are that you'll run into an incompetent contractor even without being deceived by fake testimonials... most likely, you will spend your time and money on underqualified work that you will have to redo."
-- [Freelancer.com Review, Lemon.io](https://lemon.io/blog/freelancer-review/)

> "Not a service, not a product, and not even a draft. It was nothing more than a broken link and empty promises."
-- Customer complaint on [PissedConsumer](https://fiverr.pissedconsumer.com/review.html)

**Handoff Friction (The #1 Problem):**
> "Each unclear handoff adds friction, each unspoken assumption adds noise, and eventually the project feels harder than the work itself."
-- [Flow Freelance](https://flowfreelance.everything-ok.co.kr/2026/02/a-cooperative-way-to-clarify-client.html)

> "A client gets a website fully built, launches it, and then wants to make updates... they realize they don't know what they're doing and may hire a new developer to fix bugs and add pages."
-- [freeCodeCamp Forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-hand-off-website-to-client/469641)

**Scope Creep:**
> "The number one frustration of freelancers is scope creep and over-demanding clients."
-- [Fiverr Workspace Blog](https://workspace.fiverr.com/blog/what-are-clients-biggest-frustrations-with-freelancers-how-can-you-overcome-them/)

### Freelancer Complaints About Platforms

**Upwork Fee Frustration:**
> "VERY frustrating... for many freelancers, this can represent $5,000-$10,000 in annual fees."
-- [Freelancer Files](https://freelancerfiles.com/blogs/news/increased-upwork-fees-15)

> "Increasing fees without a clear immediate benefit can make freelancers feel like expendable resources instead of valued partners."
-- [The Online Worker](https://theonlineworker.com/upwork-fees-in-2025-unpacking-the-twist-from-0-to-15/)

**Wix Marketplace Account Issues:**
> One freelancer reported "having their account suddenly removed without valid reason" and noted that "new accounts approved require a 60-day time period."
-- [Wix Community Forum](https://forum.wixstudio.com/t/how-i-can-removed-bad-reviews-from-my-wix-marketplace-profile/60551)

### How Freelancers Handle "Client Wants to Edit After I'm Done"

> "A web design project is rarely done the moment you finish the website--clients have questions, webpages need tweaks, and last-minute requests inevitably roll in."
-- [Elementor Blog](https://elementor.com/blog/how-to-handover-website-client/)

> "When you design for future edits, you're thinking ahead about how a non-designer will interact with each page--using intuitive structures, avoiding overly abstract layouts, and limiting decisions a client has to make."
-- [Readymag Blog](https://blog.readymag.com/design-handoff-to-non-designers/)

Common solutions freelancers use:
1. Contracts with revision limits and fees for additional edits
2. Training sessions ($50-$150/hr) to teach clients the CMS
3. Maintenance retainers ($50-$200/month)
4. Simplified editor modes (Webflow Editor, Squarespace, etc.)

---

## The Red Pine Advantage

### Why Red Pine's Model Is Fundamentally Different

Every other marketplace has the same problem: **the freelancer builds somewhere, then somehow the client needs to take over.** This creates friction:
- WordPress: Client needs to learn WordPress admin, deal with plugins, hosting
- Webflow: Client uses simplified Editor mode (better, but still a separate tool)
- Fiverr/Upwork: Freelancer delivers ZIP files, client has no idea what to do
- 99designs: Client gets design files, still needs a developer to build

**Red Pine's model:** The freelancer works in the same FreeForm editor the owner already uses. When the project is "done," there's no handoff. The owner already knows the tool. They can keep editing. The freelancer can come back for updates. Everything lives on the same platform.

### What Would Make Freelancers CHOOSE Red Pine's Editor?

Based on research, freelancers value:
1. **Design control without code complexity** -- Webflow wins freelancers with visual building that generates clean code. Red Pine's FreeForm editor already provides this.
2. **Client can't break things** -- Webflow's Editor mode is praised because "your client thinks HTML is a typo" but editing a heading "doesn't crash the layout." Red Pine needs permission layers (freelancer can lock sections owners shouldn't touch).
3. **No plugin headaches** -- WordPress's plugin ecosystem is seen as a burden. Red Pine has no plugins = advantage.
4. **Built-in hosting** -- Webflow's managed hosting (99.99% uptime, <50ms globally) is valued. Red Pine handles hosting natively.
5. **Money** -- Freelancers will come if clients are there. The platform that brings them leads wins. ([Source](https://www.134agency.com/blog/webflow-vs-wordpress-for-freelancers-in-2025-which-one-is-better))

### Editor Features Needed FIRST to Attract Freelancers
Based on what competitive platforms offer:
1. **Custom CSS/HTML injection** -- Freelancers want escape hatches for advanced styling
2. **Component locking** -- Ability to lock sections so owners can't accidentally break design
3. **Version history** -- Track changes, revert to previous states
4. **Multi-page management** -- Freelancers need to manage full sites (multiple pages)
5. **Responsive design controls** -- Per-breakpoint styling (mobile, tablet, desktop)
6. **Asset management** -- Upload and organize images, fonts, icons in a library
7. **Template creation** -- Build a design once, save as template, sell in marketplace

## Revenue Opportunity Math

### Base Assumptions
- Red Pine subscription: $29/month
- Assume 1,000 active Red Pine users
- 36% of businesses use freelancers for web design ([Source](https://bloggingwizard.com/freelancing-statistics/))
- Average small business freelancer website project: $2,000-$5,000 (conservative: use $1,500 for Red Pine since AI already generates a basic site -- freelancers would be adding premium customization)

### Conservative Scenario (20% hire, $1,500 avg, 10% commission)
- 1,000 users x 20% = 200 freelancer projects
- 200 x $1,500 = $300,000 in project value
- $300,000 x 10% = **$30,000 marketplace revenue**
- Per-user: $30/user/year from marketplace alone

### Moderate Scenario (25% hire, $2,000 avg, 15% commission)
- 1,000 users x 25% = 250 freelancer projects
- 250 x $2,000 = $500,000 in project value
- $500,000 x 15% = **$75,000 marketplace revenue**
- Per-user: $75/user/year from marketplace

### Template Revenue (Additional)
If 50 freelancers sell templates at $49-$79 avg ($65), selling 20 templates/year each:
- 50 x 20 x $65 = $65,000 in template sales
- At 15% commission: **$9,750/year**

### Maintenance Retainer Revenue
If 30% of completed projects lead to monthly retainers at $100/month:
- 200 projects x 30% = 60 retainers
- 60 x $100/month x 12 = $72,000 in retainer value
- At 10% commission: **$7,200/year**

### Total Marketplace Revenue (per 1,000 users)
Conservative: $30,000 + $9,750 + $7,200 = **$46,950/year**
Moderate: $75,000 + $9,750 + $7,200 = **$91,950/year**

This is ON TOP of the $29/month subscription revenue ($348,000/year from 1,000 users).

## Cold Start Problem Solutions

The chicken-and-egg problem is the defining challenge for any two-sided marketplace. Research reveals several proven strategies:

### Strategy 1: Seed Supply First (Recommended for Red Pine)
> "Identify which side of your audience has a bigger incentive to join (usually, that's supply)... once you get enough of them, the other side is 2-10X easier to bring onboard."
-- [NFX](https://www.nfx.com/post/19-marketplace-tactics-for-overcoming-the-chicken-or-egg-problem)

**For Red Pine:** Start with freelancers. They're motivated by leads. If they can list for free and the platform promises a built-in audience of business owners, they'll join.

### Strategy 2: Provide Value Beyond Transactions
> "Offer additional value to early adopters... a freelance marketplace could offer resources on running a successful freelance business."
-- [Codica](https://www.codica.com/blog/solve-chicken-and-egg-problem-for-online-marketplace/)

**For Red Pine:** The FreeForm editor IS the value. Freelancers can use Red Pine's editor to build client sites even before the marketplace launches. Give them free workspace plans.

### Strategy 3: Start Small and Niche
> "Instead of trying to serve a broad market immediately, focus on a specific niche; this allows for more focused marketing and easier achievement of critical mass within that niche."
-- [Sharetribe](https://www.sharetribe.com/marketplace-glossary/chicken-and-egg-problem/)

**For Red Pine:** Start with ONE industry (e.g., beauty & body -- already has the deepest templates). Recruit 20-30 freelancers who specialize in beauty business websites. Market to beauty business owners on Red Pine.

### Strategy 4: Create Artificial Supply
Fiverr scraped listings from Craigslist to build initial supply. Uber paid drivers in key cities to be available. ([Source](https://www.nfx.com/post/19-marketplace-tactics-for-overcoming-the-chicken-or-egg-problem))

**For Red Pine:** Build 10-20 premium templates yourself (or commission them). These serve as both supply AND quality benchmarks for freelancers who join later.

### Strategy 5: Recruit Influencers
FreeUp advertises "top 1% of online talent." Toptal positions as "top 3% of freelance talent." ([Source](https://www.nfx.com/post/19-marketplace-tactics-for-overcoming-the-chicken-or-egg-problem))

**For Red Pine:** Curate a "Featured Pros" launch roster of 10-15 vetted freelancers. Give them prominent placement and marketing support.

## Recommendations for Red Pine

### 1. Launch Model: Directory First, Marketplace Second, Templates Third

**Phase 1 -- Curated Directory (MVP):**
- Hand-pick 20-30 freelancers across 3-4 industry specializations
- Simple profiles: portfolio images, bio, services, pricing range, reviews
- Owner submits a brief ("I need help with my website"), Red Pine manually matches
- Payments happen off-platform initially (like Wix Marketplace -- no commission complexity)
- Build trust, learn what owners need, what freelancers need
- **Timeline: 4-6 weeks of dev**

**Phase 2 -- Marketplace with Escrow:**
- Add project posting by owners
- Implement Stripe escrow (hold payment until owner approves)
- Add review/rating system (two-way: owner rates freelancer, freelancer rates owner)
- Introduce platform commission (see below)
- **Timeline: 8-12 weeks of dev**

**Phase 3 -- Template Store:**
- Freelancers can build and sell FreeForm templates
- Red Pine takes a cut of template sales
- Templates are installable with one click into any Red Pine site
- **Timeline: 4-6 weeks of dev**

### 2. Commission Structure Recommendation

Based on competitor analysis:

| Revenue Stream | Red Pine Commission | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Project work (Phase 2) | **10%** from freelancer, **0%** from owner | Lower than Fiverr (20%) and Upwork (12-13% avg). Competitive advantage. Owners pay nothing -- reduces friction. |
| Template sales (Phase 3) | **15%** | Lower than old Webflow (20%), higher than current Webflow (5%). Justified by providing the editor + marketplace + hosting. |
| Maintenance retainers | **10%** | Same as project work. Recurring revenue for Red Pine. |

**Why 10% on services:** Wix charges 0% but has no escrow and "doesn't get involved in disputes." Fiverr charges 20% + 5.5% buyer fee. Red Pine at 10% is competitive, provides escrow + dispute resolution, and still generates meaningful revenue. At scale (1,000+ projects/year), this is $150K-$500K annually.

### 3. What NOT to Build Initially

- **AI matching algorithm** -- Manual matching is fine for <100 projects/month. Build algorithm when you have data.
- **Bid/proposal system** -- Too complex for MVP. Simple brief submission + admin matching.
- **Contest model** -- 99designs' model is niche. Skip it.
- **Freelancer subscription tiers** -- Keep it simple: free to join, commission on completed work.

### 4. Editor Features Priority for Freelancer Attraction

Must-have before marketplace launch:
1. **Component/section locking** -- Freelancer locks sections so owner can only edit text/images, not layout
2. **Client preview mode** -- Share a link for client to preview before going live
3. **Custom CSS panel** -- Text input where freelancers can add custom styles
4. **Multi-page support** -- Already exists in FreeForm but needs to be robust
5. **Export/clone capability** -- Save a site as a template for reuse

Nice-to-have (Phase 2):
6. Version history/rollback
7. Custom font uploads
8. Animation controls
9. Custom code injection (HTML/JS)
10. Design system/style guide builder

### 5. Freelancer Onboarding Funnel

1. **Application** -- Portfolio review, skill verification (not automated -- human review for quality)
2. **Training** -- 15-minute video on FreeForm editor + Red Pine platform overview
3. **Test project** -- Build a sample site using Red Pine's editor (proves competency)
4. **Profile creation** -- Bio, portfolio, services, pricing, availability
5. **Featured listing** -- Top 10 freelancers get homepage placement for first 90 days

### 6. Owner Journey (The Pipeline)

The full owner-to-pro pipeline:
1. Owner signs up for Red Pine ($29/mo)
2. AI generates a basic website automatically during onboarding
3. Owner uses FreeForm editor to customize (free, included)
4. Owner hits a limit of their own skills or time
5. Red Pine surfaces: "Need help? Hire a pro who works right here in your editor"
6. Owner browses directory / submits brief
7. Red Pine matches with freelancer(s)
8. Freelancer reviews brief, sends quote
9. Owner approves, pays into escrow
10. Freelancer works IN the owner's site (same editor, same platform)
11. Owner previews, requests revisions (within agreed scope)
12. Owner approves final, payment released
13. Owner continues editing their site -- no migration, no handoff friction
14. Optional: Freelancer sets up maintenance retainer

**Step 10 is where Red Pine wins.** No other marketplace has this. The freelancer doesn't build somewhere else and export. They build right inside the owner's site. When the project ends, the owner already knows how to edit because it's the same tool they've been using.
